# Concurrent programming - C++

This project was created as part of the University of Warsaw's Concurrent programming course.

The repository contains a sequential and concurrent C++ implementation of three algorithms:
- discrete Knapsack Problem
- merge sort
- finding a maximal element

There also is a small [raport](PW.pdf) containing the comparison of the sequential and concurrent solutions.

The exact specifications of the task can be found in the [task.md](task.md) file.
